# Bloon RT Engine

The Bloon RT Engine is built on a quality-first philosophy, designed to bridge the gap between pre-rendered cinematic excellence and interactive real-time environments. By prioritizing visual integrity at every stage of the pipeline, Bloon RT ensures that creators never have to trade beauty for playability. Through a sophisticated blend of raw hardware power and intelligent optimization, it delivers high-fidelity, light-reactive worlds that run seamlessly in real-time.

## Technical Highlights
### Cinematic Ray Tracing (Native Fidelity)
Rather than relying on traditional rasterized approximations, Bloon RT utilizes advanced Ray Tracing to calculate physically accurate reflections, refractions, and global illumination. This results in a film-like depth where light behaves with true-to-life precision.

### DLSS Ray Reconstruction
To maintain peak visual clarity, the engine replaces standard, often-blurry denoisers with NVIDIA’s AI-trained Ray Reconstruction. This preserves fine geometric detail and eliminates artifacts, ensuring that moving reflections and shadows remain sharp and stable.

### AI-Driven Performance Optimization
To make cinematic quality viable for real-time use, the engine employs DLSS Super Resolution. This allows the engine to render at high internal quality while utilizing AI upscaling to maintain fluid frame rates at 4K and beyond.

### Intelligent Resource Management
To further refine performance without impacting the "quality first" mandate, Version 0.2 introduces Smart Culling. Unlike traditional distance-based culling, this system evaluates objects based on their on-screen footprint.<br>
**Contextual Scene Awareness:** By analyzing how much screen space an object occupies rather than its literal distance from the camera, the engine more accurately identifies which objects are truly necessary to the viewer's perspective.<br>
**Elimination of Pop-in:** Smart Culling utilizes a more sophisticated evaluation threshold that prevents distracting visual popping. This ensures a stable, immersive horizon where objects transition into the scene naturally and invisibly.

## The Bloon Advantage
The Bloon RT Engine is engineered for those who refuse to settle for "good enough" graphics. By centering the architecture on uncompromising visual quality and then utilizing cutting-edge AI and screen-space logic to solve the performance equation, we provide a platform where the most complex, light-saturated environments can finally exist in a real-time, interactive space.
